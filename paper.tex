\section{Introduction}

Automatic roll stabilization of single track vehicles began in earnest after
predictive motorcycle models were developed and refined throughout the 1970s.
Van Zytveld~\cite{Zytveld1975} seems to be the first to attempt to robotically
stabilize a small motorbike with a controlled inverted pendulum that mimicked
rider lean, but was not successful in demonstrating what his control model
predicted. It was not until the mid 1980s in which someone successfully
demonstrated an automatically balanced motorcycle~\cite{Ruijs1986a}. Ruijs and
Pacejka showed that steer torque driven by roll angle feedback stabilizes the
capsize mode, roll rate feedback stabilizes the weave mode of a motorcycle, and
steer angular rate feedback stabilizes the wobble mode. They also show how the
gains need to change with respect to vehicle speed. This is the simplest
controller that can stabilize a single track vehicle above a minimum speed.
Many more automatically balanced single track vehicles have been demonstrated
over the last 40 years, but none of these advancements have resulted in a
successful commercial product. Most of these robotic bicycles and motorcycles
designers did not intend for a human rider to also control the stabilized
vehicle. Although, an automatically stabilized bicycle can be controlled by a
human rider if the motor controlled steer torque and the rider applied steer
torque act on the steer in sum. Given that premise, I want to answer this
question:

Given a bicycle that has a motor (with power, torque, speed, bandwidth limits)
which can apply a torque between the rear and front frames and a set of sensors
that can give good measurements or estimates of the bicycle's steer angle,
steering rate, roll angle, and rolling rate what closed loop dynamics and
motion are possible and how might a rider controlling this stabilized bicycle
find the behavior?

Some other notes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item we only care about the lateral dynamics and handling qualities of
  \item we will only explore mathematical and computational models
\end{itemize}

\section{Model}

The linear Whipple-Carvallo bicycle model
\cite{Whipple1899a,Carvallo1899,Meijaard2007} is the simplest bicycle model
that exhibits non-minimum phase behavior and self-stablity. It can be described
by the state space equations:

\begin{align}
  \dot{\bar{x}} = \mathbf{A} \bar{x} + \mathbf{B} \bar{u}
  \textrm{ where }
  \bar{x} = \begin{bmatrix} \phi \\ \dot{\phi} \\ \delta \\ \dot{\delta} \end{bmatrix}
  \textrm{ and }
  \bar{u} = \begin{bmatrix} T_{\phi} \\ T_{\delta} \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

The states are the roll angle \(\phi\) and steer angle \(\delta\) along with
their derivatives and the inputs are roll torque \(T_\phi\) and steer torque
\(T_\delta\). The state \(\mathbf{A}\) and input \(\mathbf{B}\) matrices are
populated with expressions that are functions of 27 geometric and inertial
parameters of the nonholonomic mulitbody system made up of four rigid bodies:
two wheels, front frame, and rear frame.

I use realistic numeric values for the state and input matrices measured from a
Batatuvs Browser Dutch-style city bicycle and a XX kg rider whos inertira
properties were estimated using the method of Yeadon. These calculations were
performed with the BicycleParameters and yeadon software \cite{Dembia2015}. The
following table gives the numerical values of the vehicle.

TODO: Add table of parameters.

\end{figure}

\section{Controllability}

The Whipple-Carvallo model can be uncontrollable at specific speeds.
\cite{Schwab2010a} showed uncontrollable speeds for two extended
Whipple-Carvallo models (with rider lean) and their degree of uncontrollability
using modal controllability. It is also true that the non-extended
Whipple-Carvallo model exhibits uncontrollable speeds when controlling with
steer torque, but notably \(v=0\) is not one of those speeds.

The controllability matrix \(\mathbf{C}\) can be formed for the steer input,
\(T_\delta\). There are speed parameter values where the linear
Whipple-Carvallo bicycle model is uncontrollable. Solving the
\(det(\mathbf{C}(v))=0\) returns two speeds in the range \([0, 10]\) m/s that
are uncontrollable.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/uncontrolled-eigenvalues-with-rider.png}
  \caption{Real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues as a function of speed.
  Vertical black lines indicate uncontrollable dynamics.}
  \label{fig:uncontrolled-eigenvalues-with-rider}
\end{figure}

I have no idea why this model is uncontrollable at these specific speeds.

We can also look at the modal controllability to see the degree of
controllability Fig.~\ref{fig:modal-controllability}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/modal-controllability.png}
  \caption{Testing}
  \label{fig:modal-controllability}
\end{figure}

I don't think this model controllability calc is correct because it isn't
smooth and it doesn't reveal the two uncontrollable speeds.

\section{Stabilization with Roll and Steer Feedback}

One IMU on the handlebars and one on the rear frame easily gives: roll rate and
steer rate. Steer angle sensor gives steer angle. Roll angle must be estimated.

Single motor that applies a torque between the rear frame and the
handlebars/fork.

Assume that the torque between the two frames is the sum of the motor and the
rider:

\begin{align}
  T_\delta = T_{\delta,\textrm{human}} + T_{\delta,\textrm{motor}}
\end{align}

The motor is driven by a full state feedback controller:

\begin{align}
  T_{\delta,\textrm{motor}} =
  k_\phi \phi +
  k_\delta \delta +
  k_{\dot{\phi}} \dot{\phi} +
  k_{\dot{\delta}} \dot{\delta}
\end{align}

The motor closed loop dynamics is then:

\begin{align}
  \dot{\bar{x}} = \left( \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B} \mathbf{K} \right) \bar{x} +
  \mathbf{B} \left[ T_\phi \quad T_{\delta,\textrm{human}} \right]^T \\
\end{align}

where

\begin{align}
  \mathbf{K} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    k_\phi & k_\delta & k_{\dot{\phi}} & k_{\dot{\delta}}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Note that the rider still applies steer torque through the original B matrix
and any roll disturbances also through same B matrix. The human controlled
dynamics can be manipulated by changing the motor controller gains.

\section{Proportional Dervivative Roll Control}

Proportional Derivative Roll Control

\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the achievable closed loop dynamics?
  \item Vary speed and controller gain, show 3D root locus
  \item Pick a speed and vary the controller gain, show 2D root locus
  \item Difference with and without a rigid rider
  \item Could be PD on roll rate criteria (overshoot, decay time) and then pole
    placement with the two parameters for each speed to get similar behavior
    across speeds.
  \item What if we only have rate feedback (raw IMU data)? Does steer rate
    feedback help?
\end{itemize}

It is well known that at low speeds simple proportional positive feedback of
roll rate stabilize the bicycle. This is positive roll derivative feedback.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/roll-rate-eig-effect.png}
  \caption{Effect on the motor controlled closed loop dynamics with changing
  \(k_{\dot{\phi}}\). Blue to yellow varies the gain from zero to a large
  value.}
  \label{fig:roll-rate-eig-effect}
\end{figure}

Roll rate feedback alone is not sufficient to stabilize the bicycle at very low
speeds (< 0.5 m/s), even with infinite gains, and speeds where the capsize mode
is unstable. But if roll angle and roll rate are available to feedback, the
bicycle can also be stabilized at the higher speeds. If you gain schedule roll
angle and roll rate feedback to both stabilize sufficiently while minimizing
the weave frequency exponential functions provide a good model for gain
scheduling with respect to speed.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/pd-gains-vs-speed.png}
  \caption{Exponentially scheduled roll angle and roll rate gains with respect
  to speed.}
  \label{fig:pd-gains-vs-speed}
\end{figure}

The roll PD gain scheduling with respect to speed stabilizes at all speeds
above about 0.75 m/s and retains similar dynamics except that the weave
frequency is significantly higher \ref{fig:pd-eigenvalues}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/pd-eigenvalues.png}
  \caption{Root locus of the eigenvalues components with respect to speed when
  the gain scheduling in Figure \ref{fig:pd-gains-vs-speed} are applied. Grey
  lines are the uncontrolled bicycle.}
  \label{fig:pd-eigenvalues}
\end{figure}

At very low speeds large steer torques and steer angles are required to
stabilize the system.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/pd-simulation.png}
  \caption{Simulation with saturated steer torque.}
  \label{fig:pd_simulation}
\end{figure}

\section{Full State Feedback}

If you now assume full state feedback and we drive the state to zero as before,
an LQR controller can be realized at each speed. Assumed \(\mathbf{Q}\) and
\(\mathbf{R}\) to be identity for simplicity. I also scale the gains
proportionally to limit the maximum torque that can be applied for some
expected maximum motion. If you dot that, you get some LQR gain scheduling over
speed.  The required gains at the uncontrollable points go to infinity, so you
basically can't stabilize below the largest uncontrollable speed.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/lqr-gains.png}
  \caption{Gain scheduled LQR gains.}
  \label{fig:lqr-gains}
\end{figure}

Using the scheduling in Figure \ref{fig:lqr-gains} give the dynamics in Figure
\ref{fig:lqr-eig}. The LQR solution manages to stabilize the system without
drastically changing the dynamics, in particular the weave frequency is
unchanged. If large gains are permitted, the LQR controller theoretically can
stabilize the bicycle at v=0 speed.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/lqr-eig.png}
  \caption{Root locus of eigenvalue components with the LQR gain scheduling.}
  \label{fig:lqr-eig}
\end{figure}

Here is a low speed simulation with LQR solution.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/lqr-simulation.png}
  \caption{Testing}
  \label{fig:lqr-simulation}
\end{figure}

What do the transfer functions from human steer to roll look like when they are
controlling the closed loop motor controlled bike? For a very low speed, there
is a damped resonant peak around 3 rad/s which changes the way the vehicle
feels in the human control bandwidth.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/lqr-steer-roll-bode-compare-v01.png}
  \caption{Orange is with the motor control on, blue is without.}
  \label{fig:lqr-steer-roll-bode-compare-v01}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/lqr-steer-roll-bode-compare-v05.png}
  \caption{Orange is with the motor control on, blue is without.}
  \label{fig:lqr-steer-roll-bode-compare-v05}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/lqr-steer-roll-bode-compare-v10.png}
  \caption{Orange is with the motor control on, blue is without.}
  \label{fig:lqr-steer-roll-bode-compare-v10}
\end{figure}

Would it be better/possible to ask for the gains that make the Bode plot of
controlled bike match the uncontrolled bike at high speeds? This would give
matching feeling to the rider.

\section{Motor limitations}

Set bounds on steer torque, power, and even bandwidth then solve for the open
loop steer torque needed to stabilize at various speeds.

Set bounds on steer torque, power, and even bandwidth then solve for the open
loop steer torque and solve for the four gains that stabilize the system with
under maximal performance bounds.

Is it of value to add a motor dynamics equation into the mix? A full state
feedback would then require measuring motor current.
